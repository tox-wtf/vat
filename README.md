<h2 align="center">Version Aggregator and Tracker</h2>

Vat aggregates and tracks arbitrarily many versions for a collection of
packages. Though designed with Linux From Scratch maintenance in mind, Vat
is adaptable to most tasks requiring version fetching. The version database is
updated every ~6 hours (as long as my server doesn't randomly go offline).

Feature set:
- Standard and arbitrary version channels
- Single and bulk requests
- Nested packages
- Multiple APIs
- Caching


## Using the APIs
Two APIs are provided for convenience. Choose whichever works better for your
use case.

> [!WARNING]
> API stability is not currently guaranteed, though I'll try not to break it.

You may choose to use any of the following API base URLS:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tox-wtf/vat/refs/heads/master/p/
- https://vat.tox.wtf/

The `curl` commands below will assume the `VAT_URL` environment variable is set
to one of the above URLs. For example:
```sh
export VAT_URL=https://vat.tox.wtf/
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some mirrors may elide `/p/` if they only host the package database.


### Plaintext API
The plaintext API is accessible through a file hierarchy. Individual version
channels are stored in files under `$package/channels/$channel`. This API
was designed to be used easily from a shell with standard utilities.

#### Examples
To check the release version channel of ffmpeg:
```sh
curl -fsSL "$VAT_URL/ffmpeg/channels/release"
```

To check the sdk version channel of glslang:
```sh
curl -fsSL "$VAT_URL/glslang/channels/sdk"
```

To retrieve the release, unstable, and commit version channels of bc, saving
them to variables, in a single request:
```sh
curl -fsSL "$VAT_URL/bc/versions.txt" > _
release=$(grep release _ | cut -f2)
unstable=$(grep unstable _ | cut -f2)
commit=$(grep commit _ | cut -f2)
rm _
```

To retrieve all version channels for all packages, display them, and then parse
out acl's release and inih's commit:
```sh
curl -fsSL "$VAT_URL/ALL.txt" > _

# display versions prettily
expand -t 32,44 _

acl_release=$(grep acl _ | grep release | cut -f3)
inih_commit=$(grep 'inih\scommit' _ | cut -f3)
rm _
```

To count the number of tracked release versions:
```sh
curl -fsSL "$VAT_URL/ALL.txt" |
    grep '\srelease\s' |
    wc -l
```


### JSON API

#### Examples
To retrieve a JSON object of all version channels of btop:
```sh
curl -fsSL "$VAT_URL/btop/versions.json"
```

To retrieve all versions and parse out lz4's release:
```sh
curl -fsSL "$VAT_URL/ALL.json" |
    jq -r '
    .[] |
    select(.package == "lz4") |
    .versions[] |
    select(.channel == "release") |
    .version
    '
```


## Running
Vat must be run from its source directory. This is by design as Vat is intended
to be run in a controlled/contained environment, and doing so reduces
complexity.

To test that all packages work, execute the following command:
```bash
make test
```

To update the database, execute the following command:
```bash
make run
```

> [!TIP]
> You may want to reset the runcount:
> ```bash
> printf 0 > runcount
> ```


### Dependencies

#### Required
- GCC libraries
- Glibc

#### Buildtime
- Cargo
- Make

#### Runtime

## Roadmap

### Collaboration
I'd love to work alongside anyone building a package repository, and I want this
to be a community-driven project. I'm open to tracking new packages. For more
information, read [the contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
